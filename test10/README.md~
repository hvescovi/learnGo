## leader notifying 

Inspired by the last phrases of this link:
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/examples/guestbook#step-two-fire-up-the-redis-master-service

A leader is a POD running under a service leader, svcleader.

Followers will run in PODs running under a service, called svcslave.

When a follower starts, it will "connect" in the svcleader and will "hear" for updates. Like shared registers, maybe.
