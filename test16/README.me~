## running an application in kubernetes, getting the endpoints, a lot of little examples

When an application is replicated in kubernetes (replicated PODS), 
it is useful to find the endpoints, i.e., discovery the IP of the
replicated PODS. We have to find it to implement protocol that 
could establish a total order when accepting requests.

There is an API that gets the endpoints: /api/v1/endpoints

We have to process it and get the endpoints of an specified service.
